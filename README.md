# NAO_ASD_repository

This repository contains resources related to the research project exploring the use of a NAO humanoid robot to support medical visits for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The project investigates two intuitive control methods—**Assistant Mode** and **Puppet Mode**—to help healthcare professionals effectively interact with and operate the NAO robot during clinical procedures.


## Project Overview

Children with ASD often face anxiety and communication challenges in medical settings. Social robots, like NAO, can offer a calming and engaging presence to reduce stress and enhance cooperation. This project focuses on improving the **usability** of NAO robots in pediatric healthcare by implementing and evaluating two novel control modes:

- **Assistant Mode**: Uses a Large Language Model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, to interpret clinician commands and autonomously generate appropriate robot behaviors.
- **Puppet Mode**: Allows manual control of the NAO robot through a graphical user interface (GUI) for NAO's movements and speech control.

The goal is to simplify robot operation from the perspective of clinicians and support an engaging and safe environment for both medical staff and children with ASD during medical visits.

# Dataset
The [`nao_EAS.csv`][./nao_EAS.csv] contains anonymized results from the EAS (Ethical Acceptability Scale) questionnaire completed by medical staff evaluating ethical perception of a social robot in clinical settings.

The [`nao_quest_complete.csv`][./nao_quest_complete.csv] contains all the questionnaire responses.
